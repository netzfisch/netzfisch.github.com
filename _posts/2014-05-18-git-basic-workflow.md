I'm not coding that often, but when the exception happens I often end up with a 'task' and the knowledge that there is a better way to handle the source code - but I can't remember!

Therefore I wrote a condensed **[cheat cheat][1]** with some **plain and ordinarily commands**, don't expect fancy tricks as it is more a **mnemonic** for me. Instead of re-writing **git man-pages** I organized it by thinking in **workflows** ... have a look [here][1]!
