Was not that easy, as I thought in my [last post][1], because Github-Pages ([gh-pages][2]) do **not allow any custom plugins!**. So I came up with the following strategy used by [Octopress][3] and well described from [Aleksey][4]:

1. First create a scecond branch called e.g. *source*
2. Make it default at [github][5]
